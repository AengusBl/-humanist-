# Humanist
Humanist is a macOS keyboard layout designed by [Andreas Schmidhauser](https://github.com/schmidhauser) to allow anyone to easily type on a UK QWERTY keyboard not only in English, French, German, Irish, Portuguese, Spanish, etc. but also in Mycenaean, Ancient and Modern Greek as well as in the IPA.
This fork introduces the Cyrillic alphabet instead of the Greek alphabet, and some tweaks to accommodate Nordic languages and languages that use ⟨Çç⟩ (that last part may not be necessary, I may have missed the C with cedilla).
